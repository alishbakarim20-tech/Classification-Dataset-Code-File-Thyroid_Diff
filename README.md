# Classification-Dataset-Code-File-Thyroid_Diff
Thyroid_Diff is a machine learning project that classifies thyroid conditions (normal, hypothyroid, hyperthyroid) using patient data like TSH, T3, and T4 levels. It preprocesses data, trains models such as SVM, KNN, and Random Forest, and evaluates accuracy to support early, data-driven thyroid diagnosis.
